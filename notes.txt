
Author notes:
 There exists a way to get text from a googledocs, not sheets.
  That might help someday.

PROGRESS:

NAME INPUT(done)

RACES(wip)
LINEAGES(wip)
SUBRACES(wip)
MUTANTS(done)

CLANS(wip)
TRIBES(wip)

CLASSES
SUBCLASES(unsuported)

LEVELS(half there, waiting for updates. 
Might come from google sheets data in the future).


STATS(for the end)
Author notes: could be just rolling and mod calculation, then
the changes made by race and etc can be done mannually.



Issues:
Copy paste keeps the ugly background color

changing the stat doesn't update properly in sheet

background changes adds two blank spaces under the background name.

Must delete features text and it might be added in js.
